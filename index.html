            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">India has made progress in increasing the attainment rate of primary
                education. In 2011, Approximately 75% of the population, aged between 7 and 10 years, was literate.[5]
                India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic
                development.[6] Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been
                credited to various public institutions. While enrollment in higher education has increased steadily
                over the past decade, reaching a gross enrollment ratio of 24% in 2013,[7] there still remains a
                significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations,[8] a
                challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from
                India's comparatively young population.</p>

                education
                goes by many names and comes in a variety of styles, but at its core:
                “Online education is electronically supported learning that relies on the Internet for teacher/student
                interaction and the distribution of class materials.”
                From this simple deﬁnition comes an almost inﬁnite number of ways to teach and learn outside of
                traditional
                classrooms and away from college campuses. With online education, students can turn anywhere with
                Internet
                access and electricity into a classroom. It can include audio, video, text, animations, virtual training
                environments and live chats with professors. It’s a rich learning environment with much more ﬂexibility
                than
                a traditional classroom.
                When used to its full potential, online education has been shown to be more effective than pure
                face-to-face
                instruction. It can be engaging, fun and tailored to ﬁt almost anyone’s schedule. </p>
